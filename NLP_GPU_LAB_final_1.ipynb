A transmit-ter sends high frequency sound waves into the body,where they bounce off the different tissues and organs toproduce a distinctive pattern of echoes. A receiver“hears” the returning echo pattern and forwards it to acomputer, which translates the data into an image on atelevision screen. Because ultrasound can distinguishsubtle variations between soft, fluid-filled tissues, it isparticularly useful in providing diagnostic images of theabdomen. Ultrasound can also be used in treatment.',\n  'Purpose',\n  'The potential medical applications of ultrasound',\n  'were first recognized in the 1940s as an outgrowth of thesonar technology developed to detect submarines duringWorld War II. The first useful medical images were pro-duced in the early 1950s, and, by 1965, ultrasound quali-ty had improved to the point that it came into generalmedical use. Improvements in the technology, applica-tion, and interpretation of ultrasound continue. Its lowcost, versatility, safety and speed have brought it into thetop drawer of medical imaging techniques.While pelvic ultrasound is widely known and com-',\n  'monly used for fetal monitoring during pregnancy ,',\n  'ultrasound is also routinely used for general abdominalimaging. It has great advantage over x-ray imaging tech-nologies in that it does not damage tissues with ionizingradiation. Ultrasound is also generally far better thanplain x rays at distinguishing the subtle variations of softtissue structures, and can be used in any of severalmodes, depending on the need at hand.',\n  'As an imaging tool, abdominal ultrasound generally'],\n ['is warranted for patients afflicted with: chronic or acuteabdominal pain ; abdominal trauma; an obvious or sus-',\n  'pected abdominal mass; symptoms of liver disease, pan-creatic disease, gallstones , spleen disease, kidney dis-',\n  'ease and urinary blockage; or symptoms of an abdominalaortic aneurysm . Specifically:',\n  '• Abdominal pain. Whether acute or chronic, pain can',\n  'signal a serious problem—from organ malfunction orinjury to the presence of malignant growths. Ultrasoundscanning can help doctors quickly sort through poten-tial causes when presented with general or ambiguoussymptoms. All of the major abdominal organs can bestudied for signs of disease that appear as changes insize, shape and internal structure.',\n  '• Abdominal trauma. After a serious accident, such as a',\n  'car crash or a fall, internal bleeding from injuredabdominal organs is often the most serious threat tosurvival. Neither the injuries nor the bleeding areimmediately apparent. Ultrasound is very useful as aninitial scan when abdominal trauma is suspected, and itcan be used to pinpoint the location, cause, and severityof hemorrhaging. In the case of puncture wounds ,f r o m',\n  'a bullet for example, ultrasound can locate the foreignobject and provide a preliminary survey of the damage.The easy portability and versatility of ultrasound tech-nology has brought it into common emergency roomuse, and even into limited ambulance service.'],\n ['• Abdominal mass. Abnormal growths—tumors, cysts,',\n  'abscesses, scar tissue and accessory organs—can beA',\n  'GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 1 located and tentatively identified with ultrasound. In',\n  'particular, potentially malignant solid tumors can bedistinguished from benign fluid-filled cysts andabscesses. Masses and malformations in any organ orpart of the abdomen can be found.',\n  '• Liver disease. The types and underlying causes of liver',\n  'disease are numerous, though jaundice tends to be a',\n  'general symptom. Ultrasound can differentiate betweenmany of the types and causes of liver malfunction, andis particularly good at identifying obstruction of thebile ducts and cirrhosis , which is characterized by',\n  'abnormal fibrous growths and reduced blood flow.'],\n ['• Pancreatic disease. Inflammation and malformation of',\n  'the pancreas are readily identified by ultrasound, as arepancreatic stones (calculi), which can disrupt properfunctioning.',\n  '• Gallstones. Gallstones cause more hospital admissions',\n  'than any other digestive malady. These calculi cancause painful inflammation of the gallbladder and alsoobstruct the bile ducts that carry digestive enzymesfrom the gallbladder and liver to the intestines. Gall-stones are readily identifiable with ultrasound.',\n  '• Spleen disease. The spleen is particularly prone to',\n  'injury during abdominal trauma. It may also becomepainfully inflamed when beset with infection orcancer . These conditions also lend themselves well to',\n  'ultrasonic inspection and diagnosis.',\n  '• Kidney disease. The kidneys are also prone to traumatic'],\n ['injury and are the organs most likely to form calculi,which can block the flow of urine and cause blood poi-',\n  'soning (uremia). A variety of diseases causing distinct',\n  'changes in kidney morphology can also lead to com-plete kidney failure. Ultrasound imaging has provenextremely useful in diagnosing kidney disorders.',\n  '• Abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a bulging weak',\n  'spot in the abdominal aorta, which supplies blooddirectly from the heart to the entire lower body. Theseaneurysms are relatively common and increase inprevalence with age. A burst aortic aneurysm is immi-nently life-threatening. However, they can be readilyidentified and monitored with ultrasound before acutecomplications result.',\n  'Ultrasound technology can also be used for treat-',\n  'ment purposes, most frequently as a visual aid duringsurgical procedures—such as guiding needle placementto drain fluid from a cyst, or to extract tumor cells forbiopsy. Increasingly, direct therapeutic applications forultrasound are being developed.',\n  'The direct therapeutic value of ultrasonic waves lies'],\n ['in their mechanical nature. They are shock waves, just likeaudible sound, and vibrate the materials through whichthey pass. These vibrations are mild, virtually unnotice-',\n  'able at the frequencies and intensities used for imaging.Properly focused however, high-intensity ultrasound canbe used to heat and physically agitate targeted tissues.',\n  'High-intensity ultrasound is used routinely to treat',\n  'soft tissue injuries, such as strains, tears and associatedscarring. The heating and agitation are believed to pro-mote rapid healing through increased circulation. Strong-ly focused, high-intensity, high-frequency ultrasound canalso be used to physically destroy certain types oftumors, as well as gallstones and other types of calculi.Developing new treatment applications for ultrasound isan active area of medical research.',\n  'Precautions',\n  'Properly performed, ultrasound imaging is virtually',\n  'without risk or side effects. Some patients report feelinga slight tingling and/or warmth while being scanned, butmost feel nothing at all. Ultrasound waves of appropriatefrequency and intensity are not known to cause or aggra-vate any medical condition, though any woman whothinks she might be pregnant should raise the issue withher doctor before undergoing an abdominal ultrasound.',\n  'The value of ultrasound imaging as a medical tool,'],\n ['however, depends greatly on the quality of the equipmentused and the skill of the medical personnel operating it.Improperly performed and/or interpreted, ultrasound canbe worse than useless if it indicates that a problem existswhere there is none, or fails to detect a significant condi-tion. Basic ultrasound equipment is relatively inexpen-sive to obtain, and any doctor with the equipment canperform the procedure whether qualified or not. Patientsshould not hesitate to verify the credentials of techni-cians and doctors performing ultrasounds, as well as thequality of the equipment used and the benefits of the pro-posed procedure.',\n  'In cases where ultrasound is used as a treatment tool,',\n  'patients should educate themselves about the proposedprocedure with the help of their doctors—as is appropri-ate before any surgical procedure. Also, any abdominalultrasound procedure, diagnostic or therapeutic, may behampered by a patient’s body type or other factors, suchas the presence of excessive bowel gas (which is opaqueto ultrasound). In particular, very obese people are oftennot good candidates for abdominal ultrasound.',\n  'Description',\n  'Ultrasound includes all sound waves above the fre-',\n  'quency of human hearing—about 20 thousand hertz, orcycles per second.

In medi-',\n  'cine, morphology refers to the size, shape andstructure rather than the function of a given organ.As a diagnostic imaging technique, ultrasound facil-itates the recognition of abnormal morphologies assymptoms of underlying conditions.',\n  'GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3Abdominal ultrasoundGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 3 Higher frequency ultrasound waves produce more',\n  'detailed images, but are also more readily absorbed andso cannot penetrate as deeply into the body. Abdominalultrasound imaging is generally performed at frequenciesbetween 2-5 MHz.',\n  'An ultrasound machine consists of two parts: the',\n  'transducer and the analyzer. The transducer both producesthe sound waves that penetrate the body and receives thereflected echoes. Transducers are built around piezoelec-tric ceramic chips. (Piezoelectric refers to electricity thatis produced when you put pressure on certain crystalssuch as quartz). These ceramic chips react to electric puls-es by producing sound waves ( they are transmittingwaves) and react to sound waves by producing electricpulses (receiving). Bursts of high frequency electric puls-es supplied to the transducer causes it to produce thescanning sound waves. The transducer then receives thereturning echoes, translates them back into electric pulsesand sends them to the analyzer—a computer that orga-nizes the data into an image on a television screen.',\n  'Because sound waves travel through all the body’s',\n  'tissues at nearly the same speed—about 3,400 miles perhour—the microseconds it takes for each echo to bereceived can be plotted on the screen as a distance into thebody. The relative strength of each echo, a function of thespecific tissue or organ boundary that produced it, can beplotted as a point of varying brightness. In this way, theechoes are translated into a picture. Tissues surroundedby bone or filled with gas (the stomach, intestines andbowel) cannot be imaged using ultrasound, because thewaves are blocked or become randomly scattered.'],\n ['Four different modes of ultrasound are used in med-',\n  'ical imaging:',\n  '• A-mode. This is the simplest type of ultrasound in',\n  'which a single transducer scans a line through the bodywith the echoes plotted on screen as a function ofdepth. This method is used to measure distances withinthe body and the size of internal organs. Therapeuticultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is alsoA-mode, to allow for pinpoint accurate focus of thedestructive wave energy.',\n  '• B-mode. In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of trans-',\n  'ducers simultaneously scans a plane through the bodythat can be viewed as a two-dimensional image onscreen. Ultrasound probes containing more than 100transducers in sequence form the basis for these mostcommonly used scanners, which cost about $50,000.',\n  '• M-Mode. The M stands for motion. A rapid sequence',\n  'of B-mode scans whose images follow each other insequence on screen enables doctors to see and mea-sure range of motion, as the organ boundaries thatproduce reflections move relative to the probe. M-mode ultrasound has been put to particular use in'],\n ['studying heart motion.',\n  '• Doppler mode. Doppler ultrasonography includes the',\n  'capability of accurately measuring velocities of movingmaterial, such as blood in arteries and veins. The prin-ciple is the same as that used in radar guns that measurethe speed of a car on the highway. Doppler capability ismost often combined with B-mode scanning to produceimages of blood vessels from which blood flow can bedirectly measured. This technique is used extensively toinvestigate valve defects, arteriosclerosis and hyper-',\n  'tension , particularly in the heart, but also in the abdom-',\n  'inal aorta and the portal vein of the liver. Thesemachines cost about $250,000.',\n  'The actual procedure for a patient undergoing an',\n  'abdominal ultrasound is relatively simple, regardless ofthe type of scan or its purpose. Fasting for at least eight',\n  'hours prior to the procedure ensures that the stomach isempty and as small as possible, and that the intestinesand bowels are relatively inactive. Fasting also allows thegall bladder to be seen, as it contracts after eating andmay not be seen if the stomach is full. In some cases, afull bladder helps to push intestinal folds out of the wayso that the gas they contain does not disrupt the image.The patient’s abdomen is then greased with a special gelthat allows the ultrasound probe to glide easily across theskin while transmitting and receiving ultrasonic pulses.'],\n ['This procedure is conducted by a doctor with the',\n  'assistance of a technologist skilled in operating theequipment. The probe is moved around the abdomen toobtain different views of the target areas. The patient willlikely be asked to change positions from side to side andto hold their breath as necessary to obtain the desiredviews. Discomfort during the procedure is minimal.',\n  'The many types and uses of ultrasound technology',\n  'makes it difficult to generalize about the time and costsinvolved. Relatively simple imaging—scanning a suspi-cious abdominal mass or a suspected abdominal aorticaneurysm—will take about half an hour to perform andwill cost a few hundred dollars or more, depending onthe quality of the equipment, the operator and other fac-tors. More involved techniques such as multiple M-modeand Doppler-enhanced scans, or cases where the targetsnot well defined in advance, generally take more timeand are more expensive.',\n  'Regardless of the type of scan used and the potential',\n  'difficulties encountered, ultrasound remains faster andless expensive than computed tomography scans (CT),',\n  'its primary rival in abdominal imaging.

Septic abscesses can occur any-where in the body. Only a germ and the body’s immuneresponse are required. In response to the invading germ,white blood cells gather at the infected site and beginproducing chemicals called enzymes that attack the germby digesting it. These enzymes act like acid, killing thegerms and breaking them down into small pieces that canbe picked up by the circulation and eliminated from thebody. Unfortunately, these chemicals also digest bodytissues. In most cases, the germ produces similar chemi-cals. The result is a thick, yellow liquid—pus—contain-ing digested germs, digested tissue, white blood cells,and enzymes.'],\n ['An abscess is the last stage of a tissue infection that',\n  'begins with a process called inflammation. Initially, asthe invading germ activates the body’s immune system,several events occur:',\n  '• Blood flow to the area increases.• The temperature of the area increases due to the',\n  'increased blood supply.',\n  '• The area swells due to the accumulation of water, blood,',\n  'and other liquids.',\n  '• It turns red.• It hurts, because of the irritation from the swelling and',\n  'the chemical activity.'],\n ['These four signs—heat, swelling, redness, and pain—',\n  'characterize inflammation.',\n  'As the process progresses, the tissue begins to turn',\n  'to liquid, and an abscess forms. It is the nature of anabscess to spread as the chemical digestion liquefiesmore and more tissue. Furthermore, the spreading fol-lows the path of least resistance—the tissues most easilydigested. A good example is an abscess just beneath theskin. It most easily continues along beneath the skinrather than working its way through the skin where itcould drain its toxic contents. The contents of the abscessalso leak into the general circulation and produce symp-toms just like any other infection. These include chills,fever , aching, and general discomfort.',\n  'Sterile abscesses are sometimes a milder form of the',\n  'same process caused not by germs but by non-living irri-tants such as drugs. If an injected drug like penicillin isnot absorbed, it stays where it was injected and maycause enough irritation to generate a sterile abscess—sterile because there is no infection involved. Sterileabscesses are quite likely to turn into hard, solid lumps asthey scar, rather than remaining pockets of pus.Causes and symptoms',\n  'Many different agents cause abscesses. The most',\n  'common are the pus-forming (pyogenic) bacteria likeStaphylococcus aureus , which is nearly always the cause'],\n ['of abscesses under the skin. Abscesses near the largebowel, particularly around the anus, may be caused byany of the numerous bacteria found within the largebowel. Brain abscesses and liver abscesses can be causedby any organism that can travel there through the circula-tion. Bacteria, amoeba, and certain fungi can travel inthis fashion. Abscesses in other parts of the body arecaused by organisms that normally inhabit nearby struc-tures or that infect them.

The vestibular and cochlearnerves lie next to one another. They also run along sideother cranial nerves. People possess two of each type ofvestibulocochlear nerve, one that extends from the leftear and one that extends from the right ear.',\n  'The vestibular nerve transmits information concern-'],\n ['ing balance from the inner ear to the brain and the cochlearnerve transmits information about hearing. The vestibularnerve, like many nerves, is surrounded by a cover called amyelin sheath. A tumor, called a schwannoma, can some-times develop from the cells of the myelin sheath. A tumoris an abnormal growth of tissue that results from theuncontrolled growth of cells. Acoustic neuromas are oftencalled vestibular schwannomas because they are tumorsthat arise from the myelin sheath that surrounds thevestibular nerve. Acoustic neuromas are consideredbenign (non-cancerous) tumors since they do not spread toother parts of the body. They can occur anywhere alongthe vestibular nerve but are most likely to occur where thevestibulocochlear nerve passes through the tiny bony canalthat connects the brain and the inner ear.',\n  'An acoustic neuroma can arise from the left vestibu-',\n  'lar nerve or the right vestibular nerve.

A person',\n  'with NF2 has inherited a predisposition for developingacoustic neuromas and other tumors of the nerve cells.',\n  'Acoustic neuromas usually grow slowly and can',\n  'take years to develop. Some acoustic neuromas remainso small that they do not cause any symptoms. As theacoustic neuroma grows it can interfere with the func-tioning of the vestibular nerve and can cause vertigo andbalance difficulties. If the acoustic nerve grows largeenough to press against the cochlear nerve, then hearing',\n  'lossand a ringing ( tinnitus ) in the affected ear will usu-'],\n ['ally occur. If untreated and the acoustic neuroma contin-ues to grow it can press against other nerves in the regionand cause other symptoms. This tumor can be life threat-ening if it becomes large enough to press against andinterfere with the functioning of the brain.',\n  'Causes and symptoms',\n  'Causes',\n  'An acoustic neuroma is caused by a change or',\n  'absence of both of the NF2 tumor suppressor genes in anerve cell. Every person possesses a pair of NF2 genes inevery cell of their body including their nerve cells. OneNF2 gene is inherited from the egg cell of the mother andone NF2 gene is inherited from the sperm cell of thefather. The NF2 gene is responsible for helping to pre-vent the formation of tumors in the nerve cells. In partic-ular the NF2 gene helps to prevent acoustic neuromas.',\n  'Only one unchanged and functioning NF2 gene is',\n  'necessary to prevent the formation of an acoustic neuro-ma. If both NF2 genes become changed or missing inone of the myelin sheath cells of the vestibular nervethen an acoustic neuroma will usually develop. Most uni-lateral acoustic neuromas result when the NF2 genesbecome spontaneously changed or missing. Someonewith a unilateral acoustic neuroma that has developedspontaneously is not at increased risk for having childrenwith an acoustic neuroma. Some unilateral acoustic neu-romas result from the hereditary condition NF2. It is alsopossible that some unilateral acoustic neuromas may becaused by changes in other genes responsible for pre-venting the formation of tumors.',\n  'Bilateral acoustic neuromas result when someone is'],\n ['affected with the hereditary condition NF2. A person withNF2 is typically born with one unchanged and onechanged or missing NF2 gene in every cell of their body.Sometimes they inherit this change from their mother orfather. Sometimes the change occurs spontaneously whenthe egg and sperm come together to form the first cell ofthe baby. The children of a person with NF2 have a 50%chance of inheriting the changed or missing NF2 gene.A person with NF2 will develop an acoustic neuro-',\n  'ma if the remaining unchanged NF2 gene becomes spon-taneously changed or missing in one of the myelin sheathcells of their vestibular nerve. People with NF2 oftendevelop acoustic neuromas at a younger age. The meanage of onset of acoustic neuroma in NF2 is 31 years ofage versus 50 years of age for sporadic acoustic neuro-mas. Not all people with NF2, however, develop acousticneuromas. People with NF2 are at increased risk fordeveloping cataracts and tumors in other nerve cells.',\n  'Most people with a unilateral acoustic neuroma are',\n  'not affected with NF2. Some people with NF2, however,only develop a tumor in one of the vestibulocochlearnerves. Others may initially be diagnosed with a unilater-al tumor but may develop a tumor in the other nerve anumber of years later. NF2 should be considered in some-one under the age of 40 who has a unilateral acoustic neu-roma. Someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma andother family members diagnosed with NF2 probably isaffected with NF2. Someone with a unilateral acousticneuroma and other symptoms of NF2 such as cataractsand other tumors may also be affected with NF2. On theother hand, someone over the age of 50 with a unilateralacoustic neuroma, no other tumors and no family historyof NF2 is very unlikely to be affected with NF2.',\n  'Symptoms',\n  'Small acoustic neuromas usually only interfere with',\n  'the functioning of the vestibulocochlear nerve. The mostcommon first symptom of an acoustic neuroma is hearingloss, which is often accompanied by a ringing sound (tin-nitis). People with acoustic neuromas sometimes reportdifficulties in using the phone and difficulties in perceivingthe tone of a musical instrument or sound even when theirhearing appears to be otherwise normal.

During the procedurethe tumor is removed under microscopic guidance andgeneral anesthetic. Monitoring of the neighboring cranialnerves is done during the procedure so that damage tothese nerves can be prevented. If preservation of hearingis a possibility, then monitoring of hearing will also takeplace during the surgery.',\n  'Most people stay in the hospital four to seven days',\n  'following the surgery. Total recovery usually takes fourto six weeks. Most people experience fatigue and head',\n  'discomfort following the surgery. Problems with balanceand head and neck stiffness are also common. The mor-tality rate of this type of surgery is less than 2% at mostmajor centers. Approximately 20% of patients experi-ence some degree of post-surgical complications. In mostcases these complications can be managed successfullyand do not result in long term medical problems. Surgerybrings with it a risk of stroke , damage to the brain stem,',\n  'infection, leakage of spinal fluid and damage to the cra-nial nerves.

The radi-ation is administered in a single large dose, under localanesthetic and is performed on an outpatient basis. Thisresults in a high dose of radiation to the tumor but littleradiation exposure to the surrounding area. This treat-ment approach is limited to small or medium tumors.The goal of the surgery is to cause tumor shrinkage or atleast limit the growth of the tumor. The long term effica-cy and risks of this treatment approach are not known.Periodic MRI monitoring throughout the life of thepatient is therefore recommended.'],\n ['Radiation therapy can cause hearing loss which can',\n  'sometimes occurs even years later. Radiation therapy canalso cause damage to neighboring cranial nerves, whichcan result in symptoms such as numbness, pain or paralysisof the facial muscles. In many cases these symptoms aretemporary. Radiation treatment can also induce the forma-tion of other benign or malignant schwannomas. This typeof treatment may therefore be contraindicated in the treat-ment of acoustic neuromas in those with NF2 who are pre-disposed to developing schwannomas and other tumors.',\n  'Observation',\n  'Acoustic neuromas are usually slow growing and in',\n  'some cases they will stop growing and even becomesmaller or disappear entirely. It may therefore be appro-priate in some cases to hold off on treatment and to peri-odically monitor the tumor through MRI evaluations.Long-term observation may be appropriate for examplein an elderly person with a small acoustic neuroma andfew symptoms. Periodic observation may also be indicat-ed for someone with a small and asymptomatic acousticneuroma that was detected through an evaluation foranother medical problem. Observation may also be sug-gested for someone with an acoustic neuroma in the onlyhearing ear or in the ear that has better hearing. The dan-ger of an observational approach is that as the tumorgrows larger it can become more difficult to treat.',\n  'Prognosis',\n  'The prognosis for someone with a unilateral acoustic',\n  'neuroma is usually quite good provided the tumor is diag-nosed early and appropriate treatment is instituted.

Both men and women are affected. Becausethe symptoms of acromegaly occur so gradually, diagno-sis is often delayed. The majority of patients are notidentified until they are middle aged.',\n  'Causes and symptoms',\n  'The pituitary is a small gland located at the base of',\n  'the brain. A gland is a collection of cells that releasescertain chemicals, or hormones, which are important tothe functioning of other organs or body systems. Thepituitary hormones travel throughout the body and areinvolved in a large number of activities, including theregulation of growth and reproductive functions. Thecause of acromegaly can be traced to the pituitary’s pro-duction of GH.',\n  'Under normal conditions, the pituitary receives input',\n  'from another brain structure, the hypothalamus, locatedat the base of the brain. This input from the hypothala-mus regulates the pituitary’s release of hormones. Forexample, the hypothalamus produces growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which directs the pituitaryto release GH. Input from the hypothalamus should alsodirect the pituitary to stop releasing hormones.'],\n ['In acromegaly, the pituitary continues to release GH',\n  'and ignores signals from the hypothalamus. In the liver,GH causes production of a hormone called insulin-likegrowth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is responsible for growththroughout the body. When the pituitary refuses to stopproducing GH, the levels of IGF-1 also reach abnormalpeaks. Bones, soft tissue, and organs throughout the bodybegin to enlarge, and the body changes its ability toprocess and use nutrients like sugars and fats.',\n  'In acromegaly, an individual’s hands and feet begin',\n  'to grow, becoming thick and doughy. The jaw line, nose,and forehead also grow, and facial features are describedas “coarsening”.

The variousswellings and enlargements throughout the body maypress on nerves, causing sensations of local tingling orburning, and sometimes result in muscle weakness.',\n  'The most common cause of this disorder (in 90% of',\n  'patients) is the development of a noncancerous tumor with-in the pituitary, called a pituitary adenoma. These tumorsare the source of the abnormal release of GH. As thesetumors grow, they may press on nearby structures within thebrain, causing headaches and changes in vision. As the ade-noma grows, it may disrupt other pituitary tissue, interferingwith the release of other hormones. These disruptions maybe responsible for changes in the menstrual cycle ofwomen, decreases in the sexual drive in men and women,and the abnormal production of breast milk in women. Inrare cases, acromegaly is caused by the abnormal produc-tion of GHRH, which leads to the increased production ofGH. Certain tumors in the pancreas, lungs, adrenal glands,thyroid, and intestine produce GHRH, which in turn triggersproduction of an abnormal quantity of GH.',\n  'Diagnosis',\n  'Because acromegaly produces slow changes over',\n  'time, diagnosis is often significantly delayed. In fact, thecharacteristic coarsening of the facial features is oftennot recognized by family members, friends, or long-timefamily physicians. Often, the diagnosis is suspected by anew physician who sees the patient for the first time andis struck by the patient’s characteristic facial appearance.Comparing old photographs from a number of differenttime periods will often increase suspicion of the disease.',\n  'Because the quantity of GH produced varies widely',\n  'under normal conditions, demonstrating high levels ofGH in the blood is not sufficient to merit a diagnosis ofacromegaly. Instead, laboratory tests measuring anincrease of IGF-1 (3-10 times above the normal level) are'],\n ['useful.

Auricular acupuncture uses acupuncture points onlyon the ear, which are believed to stimulate and balanceinternal organs. In France, where acupuncture is very pop-ular and more accepted by the medical establishment, neu-rologist Paul Nogier developed a system of acupuncturebased on neuroendocrine theory rather than on traditionalChinese concepts, which is gaining some use in America.',\n  'Basic ideas of Chinese medicine',\n  'Chinese medicine views the body as a small part of',\n  'the universe, and subject to universal laws and principlesof harmony and balance. Chinese medicine does notdraw a sharp line, as Western medicine does, betweenmind and body. The Chinese system believes that emo-tions and mental states are every bit as influential on dis-ease as purely physical mechanisms, and considers fac-tors like work, environment, lifestyle and relationships as',\n  'fundamental to the overall picture of a patient’s health.Chinese medicine also uses very different symbols andideas to discuss the body and health. While Western med-icine typically describes health in terms of measurablephysical processes made up of chemical reactions, theChinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi, the organ sys-tem, and the five elements to describe health and thebody. To understand the ideas behind acupuncture, it isworthwhile to introduce some of these basic terms.',\n  'YIN AND YANG. According to Chinese philosophy,',\n  'the universe and the body can be described by two sepa-rate but complementary principles, that of yin and yang.For example, in temperature, yin is cold and yang is hot.In gender, yin is female and yang is male. In activity, yinis passive and yang is active. In light, yin is dark andyang is bright; in direction yin is inward and downwardand yang is outward and up, and so on. Nothing is evercompletely yin or yang, but a combination of the two.These two principles are always interacting, opposing,and influencing each other. The goal of Chinese medi-cine is not to eliminate either yin or yang, but to allowthe two to balance each other and exist harmoniouslytogether. For instance, if a person suffers from symptoms',\n  'GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 41Acupuncture'],\n ['Conception vessel',\n  'Stomach meridian',\n  'Large intestine meridian',\n  'Gallbladder meridianGovernor vessel',\n  'Bladder meridian',\n  'Triple burner meridian',\n  'Small intestine meridian',\n  'Acupuncture sites and meridians on the face and neck.

Thus, acupuncturetherapies seek to either increase or reduce yang, orincrease or reduce yin in particular regions of the body.',\n  'CHI. Another fundamental concept of Chinese med-',\n  'icine is that of chi (pronounced chee, also spelled qi). Chi',\n  'is the fundamental life energy of the universe. It is invisi-ble and is found in the environment in the air, water, foodand sunlight. In the body, it is the invisible vital forcethat creates and animates life. We are all born with inher-ited amounts of chi, and we also get acquired chi fromthe food we eat and the air we breathe. The level andquality of a person’s chi also depends on the state ofphysical, mental and emotional balance. Chi travelsthrough the body along channels called meridians .',\n  'THE ORGAN SYSTEM. In the Chinese system, there',\n  'are twelve main organs: the lung, large intestine, stom-ach, spleen, heart, small intestine, urinary bladder, kid-ney, liver, gallbladder, pericardium, and the “triplewarmer,” which represents the entire torso region. Eachorgan has chi energy associated with it, and each organinteracts with particular emotions on the mental level. Asthere are twelve organs, there are twelve types of chiwhich can move through the body, and these movethrough twelve main channels or meridians. Chinesedoctors connect symptoms to organs. That is, symptomsare caused by yin/yang imbalances in one or moreorgans, or by an unhealthy flow of chi to or from oneKEY TERMS',\n  'Acupressure —Form of massage using acupunc-',\n  'ture points.'],\n ['Auricular acupuncture —Acupuncture using only',\n  'points found on the ears.',\n  'Chi—Basic life energy.',\n  'Meridian —Channel through which chi travels in',\n  'the body.',\n  'Moxibustion —Acupuncture technique which',\n  'burns the herb moxa or mugwort.',\n  'Tonification —Acupuncture technique for strength-'],\n ['ening the body.',\n  'Yin/Yang —Universal characteristics used to des-',\n  'cribe aspects of the natural world.organ to another. Each organ has a different profile of',\n  'symptoms it can manifest.',\n  'THE FIVE ELEMENTS. Another basis of Chinese theo-',\n  'ry is that the world and body are made up of five mainelements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. These ele-ments are all interconnected, and each element eithergenerates or controls another element. For instance,water controls fire and earth generates metal. Each organis associated with one of the five elements. The Chinesesystem uses elements and organs to describe and treatconditions. For instance, the kidney is associated withwater and the heart is associated with fire, and the twoorgans are related as water and fire are related. If the kid-ney is weak, then there might be a corresponding fireproblem in the heart, so treatment might be made byacupuncture or herbs to cool the heart system and/orincrease energy in the kidney system.',\n  'The Chinese have developed an intricate system of',\n  'how organs and elements are related to physical andmental symptoms, and the above example is a very sim-ple one. Although this system sounds suspect to Westernscientists, some interesting parallels have been observed.For instance, Western medicine has observed that withsevere heart problems, kidney failure often follows, but itstill does not know exactly why. In Chinese medicine,this connection between the two organs has long beenestablished.'],\n ['MEDICAL PROBLEMS AND ACUPUNCTURE. In Chi-',\n  'nese medicine, disease as seen as imbalances in the organsystem or chi meridians, and the goal of any remedy ortreatment is to assist the body in reestablishing its innateharmony. Disease can be caused by internal factors likeemotions, external factors like the environment andweather, and other factors like injuries, trauma, diet, andgerms. However, infection is seen not as primarily aproblem with germs and viruses, but as a weakness in theenergy of the body which is allowing a sickness to occur.In Chinese medicine, no two illnesses are ever the same,as each body has its own characteristics of symptoms andbalance. Acupuncture is used to open or adjust the flowof chi throughout the organ system, which will strength-en the body and prompt it to heal itself.',\n  'A VISIT TO THE ACUPUNCTURIST. The first thing an',\n  'acupuncturist will do is get a thorough idea of a patient’smedical history and symptoms, both physical and emo-tional. This is done with a long questionnaire and inter-view. Then the acupuncturist will examine the patient tofind further symptoms, looking closely at the tongue, thepulse at various points in the body, the complexion, gen-eral behavior, and other signs like coughs or pains.

Depending on the problem, the acupunctur-',\n  'ist will insert needles to manipulate chi on one or moreof the twelve organ meridians. On these twelve meridi-ans, there are nearly 2,000 points which can be used inacupuncture, with around 200 points being most fre-quently used by traditional acupuncturists. During anindividual treatment, one to twenty needles may be used,depending on which meridian points are chosen.',\n  'Acupuncture needles are always sterilized and',\n  'acupuncture is a very safe procedure. The depth of inser-tion of needles varies, depending on which chi channels arebeing treated. Some points barely go beyond superficiallayers of skin, while some acupuncture points require adepth of 1-3 in (2.5-7.5 cm) of needle. The needles general-ly do not cause pain. Patients sometimes report pinchingsensations and often pleasant sensations, as the body expe-riences healing. Depending on the problem, the acupunc-turist might spin or move the needles, or even pass a slightelectrical current through some of them. Moxibustion may'],\n ['be sometimes used, in which an herbal mixture (moxa ormugwort) is either burned like incense on the acupuncturepoint or on the end of the needle, which is believed to stim-ulate chi in a particular way. Also, acupuncturists some-times use cupping , during which small suction cups are',\n  'placed on meridian points to stimulate them.',\n  'How long the needles are inserted also varies. Some',\n  'patients only require a quick in and out insertion to clearproblems and provide tonification (strengthening of',\n  'health), while some other conditions might require nee-dles inserted up to an hour or more. The average visit toan acupuncturist takes about thirty minutes. The numberof visits to the acupuncturist varies as well, with someconditions improved in one or two sessions and othersrequiring a series of six or more visits over the course ofweeks or months.',\n  'Costs for acupuncture can vary, depending on whether',\n  'the practitioner is an MD. Initial visits with non-MDacupuncturists can run from $50-$100, with follow-up vis-its usually costing less. Insurance reimbursement alsovaries widely, depending on the company and state. Regu-lations have been changing often. Some states authorizeMedicaid to cover acupuncture for certain conditions, andsome states have mandated that general coverage pay foracupuncture. Consumers should be aware of the provisionsfor acupuncture in their individual policies.',\n  'Precautions'],\n ['Acupuncture is generally a very safe procedure. If a',\n  'patient is in doubt about a medical condition, more thanone physician should be consulted.

The reasonfor this is that the mechanism of acupuncture is difficult toscientifically understand or measure, such as the invisibleenergy of chi in the body. Western medicine, admitting thatacupuncture works in many cases, has theorized that theenergy meridians are actually part of the nervous system andthat acupuncture relieves pain by releasing endorphins, ornatural pain killers, into the bloodstream.

ACTH is produced in thebody by the pituitary gland, and normally acts by pro-moting growth within the adrenal cortex and stimulatingthe production and release of cortisol. In Addison’s dis-ease, even a dose of synthetic ACTH does not increasecortisol levels.',\n  'To distinguish between primary adrenocortical',\n  'insufficiency (Addison’s disease) and secondaryadrenocortical insufficiency (caused by failure of thepituitary to produce enough ACTH), levels of ACTH in',\n  'the blood are examined.

This confirms the diagnosis ofAddison’s disease.',\n  'Treatment'],\n ['Treatment of Addison’s disease involves replacing',\n  'the missing or low levels of cortisol. In the case of Addis-onian crisis, this will be achieved by injecting a potentform of steroid preparation through a needle placed in avein (intravenous or IV). Dehydration and salt loss willalso be treated by administering carefully balanced solu-tions through the IV . Dangerously low blood pressuremay require special medications to safely elevate it untilthe steroids take effect.',\n  'Patients with Addison’s disease will need to take a',\n  'steroid preparation (hydrocortisone) and a replacementfor aldosterone (fludrocortisone) by mouth for the rest oftheir lives. When a patient has an illness which causesnausea and vomiting (such that they cannot hold downtheir medications), he or she will need to enter a medicalfacility where IV medications can be administered.When a patient has any kind of infection or injury, thenormal dose of hydrocortisone will need to be doubled.',\n  'Prognosis',\n  'Prognosis for patients appropriately treated with',\n  'hydrocortisone and aldosterone is excellent.

Its formal',\n  'name is misleading, because children, as well as adults,may be affected. In the lungs the smallest blood vessels,or capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny air sacsat the tips of the smallest breathing tubes (the bronchi).This is the all-important site where oxygen passes fromair that is inhaled to the blood, which carries it to all partsof the body. Any form of lung injury that damages thispoint of contact, called the alveolo-capillary junction,will allow blood and tissue fluid to leak into the alveoli,eventually filling them so that air cannot enter. The resultis the type of breathing distress called ARDS.

Typically thesematerials join together with large molecules in the blood(proteins), to form hyaline membranes. (These mem-branes are very prominent in premature infants whodevelop respiratory distress syndrome; it is often calledhyaline membrane disease.) If ARDS is very severe orlasts a long time, the lungs do not heal, but rather becomescarred, a process known as fibrosis. The lack of a nor-mal amount of oxygen causes the blood vessels of thelung to become narrower, and in time they, too, maybecome scarred and filled with clotted blood.

Thesetests are sometimes called AIDS serology tests. Serologyis the branch of immunology that deals with the contentsand characteristics of blood serum. Serum is the clear lightyellow part of blood that remains liquid when blood cellsform a clot. AIDS serology evaluates the presence ofhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in bloodserum and its effects on each patient’s immune system.',\n  'Purpose',\n  'AIDS serology serves several different purposes.',\n  'Some AIDS tests are used to diagnose patients or con-firm a diagnosis; others are used to measure the progres-sion of the disease or the effectiveness of specific treat-ment regimens. Some AIDS tests can also be used toscreen blood donations for safe use in transfusions.'],\n ['In order to understand the different purposes of the',\n  'blood tests used with AIDS patients, it is helpful tounderstand how HIV infection affects human blood andthe immune system. HIV is a retrovirus that enters theblood stream of a new host in the following ways:',\n  '• by sexual contact',\n  '• by contact with infected body fluids (such as blood and',\n  'urine)',\n  '• by transmission during pregnancy ,o r',\n  '• through transfusion of infected blood products',\n  'A retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique enzyme'],\n ['called reverse transcriptase that allows it to replicate with-in new host cells. The virus binds to a protein called CD4,which is found on the surface of certain subtypes of whiteblood cells, including helper T cells, macrophages, andmonocytes. Once HIV enters the cell, it can replicate andkill the cell in ways that are still not completely under-stood. In addition to killing some lymphocytes directly, theAIDS virus disrupts the functioning of the remaining CD4cells. CD4 cells ordinarily produce a substance calledinterleukin-2 (IL-2), which stimulates other cells (T cellsand B cells) in the human immune system to respond toinfections. Without the IL-2, T cells do not reproduce asthey normally would in response to the HIV virus, and Bcells are not stimulated to respond to the infection.',\n  'Precautions',\n  'In some states such as New York, a signed consent',\n  'form is needed in order to administer an AIDS test. Aswith all blood tests, healthcare professionals shouldalways wear latex gloves and to avoid being pricked bythe needle used in drawing blood for the tests. Also, itmay be difficult to get blood from a habitual intravenousdrug user due to collapsed veins.',\n  'Description',\n  'Diagnostic tests',\n  'Diagnostic blood tests for AIDS are usually given to',\n  'persons in high-risk populations who may have beenexposed to HIV or who have the early symptoms ofAIDS. Most persons infected with HIV will develop adetectable level of antibody within three months of infec-tion. The condition of testing positive for HIV antibodyin the blood is called seroconversion, and persons whohave become HIV-positive are called seroconverters.'],\n ['It is possible to diagnose HIV infection by isolating',\n  'the virus itself from a blood sample or by demonstratingthe presence of HIV antigen in the blood. Viral culture,however, is expensive, not widely available, and slow—ittakes 28 days to complete the viral culture test. Morecommon are blood tests that work by detecting the pres-ence of antibodies to the HIV virus. These tests are inex-pensive, widely available, and accurate in detecting99.9% of AIDS infections when used in combination toscreen patients and confirm diagnoses.',\n  'ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA).',\n  'This type of blood test is used to screen blood for trans-fusions as well as diagnose patients. An ELISA test forHIV works by attaching HIV antigens to a plastic well orbeads. A sample of the patient’s blood serum is added,and excess proteins are removed. A second antibody cou-pled to an enzyme is added, followed by addition of asubstance that will cause the enzyme to react by forminga color. An instrument called a spectrophotometer canmeasure the color. The name of the test is derived fromthe use of the enzyme that is coupled or linked to the sec-ond antibody.',\n  'The latest generation of ELISA tests are 99.5% sen-',\n  'sitive to HIV . Occasionally, the ELISA test will be posi-tive for a patient without symptoms of AIDS from a low-risk group.

If the second ELISA is positive, the',\n  'result should be confirmed by the Western blot test.'],\n ['WESTERN BLOT (IMMUNOBLOT). The Western blot',\n  'or immunoblot test is used as a reference procedure toconfirm the diagnosis of AIDS. In Western blot testing,HIV antigen is purified by electrophoresis (large proteinmolecules are suspended in a gel and separated from oneanother by running an electric current through the gel).',\n  'GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 82AIDS testsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 82 The HIV antigens are attached by blotting to a nylon or',\n  'nitrocellulose filter. The patient’s serum is reacted againstthe filter, followed by treatment with developing chemi-cals that allow HIV antibody to show up as a coloredpatch or blot. A commercially produced Western blot testfor HIV-1 is now available. It consists of a prefabricatedstrip that is incubated with a sample of the patient’s bloodserum and the developing chemicals. About nine differentHIV-1 proteins can be detected in the blots.',\n  'When used in combination with ELISA testing,',\n  'Western blot testing is 99.9% specific.

In somepatients the Western blot yields indeterminate results.',\n  'IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ASSAY (IFA). This method',\n  'is sometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead ofWestern blotting.

This test is',\n  'used to evaluate the very small number of AIDS patientswith false-negative ELISA and Western blot tests.

An estimated 30-40% of all men in',\n  'their teens and twenties have experienced alcoholicblackout, which occurs when drinking a large quantityof alcohol results in the loss of memory of the timesurrounding the episode of drinking. Alcohol is well-known to cause sleep disturbances, so that overallsleep quality is affected. Numbness and tingling may',\n  'occur in the arms and legs. Two syndromes, which canoccur together or separately, are known as Wernicke’sand Korsakoff’s syndromes. Both are due to the lowthiamine (a form of vitamin B complex) levels foundin alcoholics. Wernicke’s syndrome results in disor-dered eye movements, very poor balance and difficultywalking, while Korsakoff’s syndrome severely',\n  'affects one’s memory, preventing new learning fromtaking place.',\n  '• Gastrointestinal system. Alcohol causes loosening of'],\n ['the muscular ring that prevents the stomach’s contentsfrom re-entering the esophagus. Therefore, the acidfrom the stomach flows backwards into the esopha-gus, burning those tissues, and causing pain and',\n  'bleeding. Inflammation of the stomach can also resultin bleeding and pain, and decreased desire to eat. Amajor cause of severe, uncontrollable bleeding (hem-orrhage) in an alcoholic is the development ofenlarged (dilated) blood vessels within the esophagus,which are called esophageal varices. These varices areactually developed in response to liver disease, andare extremely prone to bursting and hemorrhaging.Diarrhea is a common symptom, due to alcohol’s',\n  'effect on the pancreas. In addition, inflammation ofthe pancreas ( pancreatitis ) is a serious and painful',\n  'problem in alcoholics. Throughout the intestinal tract,alcohol interferes with the absorption of nutrients,creating a malnourished state. Because alcohol is bro-ken down (metabolized) within the liver, that organ isseverely affected by constant levels of alcohol. Alco-hol interferes with a number of important chemicalprocesses that also occur in the liver. The liver beginsto enlarge and fill with fat ( fatty liver ), fibrous scartissue interferes with the liver’s normal structure and',\n  'function (cirrhosis), and the liver may becomeinflamed (hepatitis).',\n  '• Blood. Alcohol can cause changes to all the types of',\n  'blood cells. Red blood cells become abnormallylarge. White blood cells (important for fighting infec-tions) decrease in number, resulting in a weakenedimmune system. This places alcoholics at increasedrisk for infections, and is thought to account in partfor the increased risk of cancer faced by alcoholics',\n  '(ten times increased over normal). Platelets and bloodclotting factors are affected, causing an increased riskof bleeding.'],\n ['• Heart. Small amounts of alcohol cause a drop in blood',\n  'pressure, but with increased use, alcohol begins toincrease blood pressure into a dangerous range. Highlevels of fats circulating in the bloodstream increase therisk of heart disease. Heavy drinking results in anincrease in heart size, weakening of the heart muscle,abnormal heart rhythms, a risk of blood clots formingwithin the chambers of the heart, and a greatlyincreased risk of stroke (due to a blood clot from the',\n  'heart entering the circulatory system, going to thebrain, and blocking a brain blood vessel).',\n  '• Reproductive system.

A clinician may begin to be suspiciouswhen a patient suffers repeated injuries or begins toexperience medical problems related to the use of alco-hol. In fact, some estimates suggest that about 20% of aphysician’s patients will be alcoholics.',\n  'Diagnosis is aided by administering specific psycho-',\n  'logical assessments that try to determine what aspects ofa person’s life may be affected by his or her use of alco-hol. Determining the exact quantity of alcohol that a per-son drinks is of much less importance than determininghow his or her drinking affects relationships, jobs, educa-tional goals, and family life. In fact, because the metabo-lism of alcohol (how the body breaks down and process-es alcohol) is so individual, the quantity of alcohol con-sumed is not part of the criteria list for diagnosing eitheralcohol dependence or alcohol abuse.',\n  'One very simple tool for beginning the diagnosis of',\n  'alcoholism is called the CAGE questionnaire. It consistsof four questions, with the first letters of each key wordspelling out the word CAGE:',\n  '• Have you ever tried to Cutdown on your drinking?',\n  '• Have you ever been Annoyed by anyone’s comments'],\n ['about your drinking?',\n  '• Have you ever felt Guilty about your drinking?• Do you ever need an Eye-opener (a morning drink of',\n  'alcohol) to start the day)?',\n  'Other, longer lists of questions exist to help deter-',\n  'mine the severity and effects of a person’s alcohol use.Given the recent research pointing to a genetic basisfor alcoholism, it is important to ascertain whetheranyone else in the person’s family has ever sufferedfrom alcoholism.',\n  'Physical examination may reveal signs suggestive',\n  'of alcoholism: evidence of old injuries; a visible networkof enlarged veins just under the skin around the navel(called caput medusae); fluid in the abdomen ( ascites );',\n  'yellowish-tone to the skin; decreased testicular size inmen; and poor nutritional status. Lab work may reveal anincrease in the size of the red blood cells; abnormalitiesin the white blood cells (cells responsible for fightinginfection) and platelets (particles responsible for clot-ting); and an increase in certain liver enzymes.'],\n ['Treatment',\n  'Treatment of alcoholism has two parts. The first step',\n  'in the treatment of alcoholism, called detoxification ,',\n  'involves helping the person stop drinking and ridding hisor her body of the harmful (toxic) effects of alcohol.Because the person’s body has become accustomed toalcohol, the person will need to be supported throughwithdrawal. Withdrawal will be different for differentpatients, depending on the severity of the alcoholism, asmeasured by the quantity of alcohol ingested daily and thelength of time the patient has been an alcoholic. With-drawal symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening.Mild withdrawal symptoms include nausea, achiness, diar-rhea, difficulty sleeping, sweatiness, anxiety , and trem-',\n  'bling. This phase is usually over in about three to fivedays. More severe effects of withdrawal can include hallu-',\n  'cinations (in which a patient sees, hears, or feels some-',\n  'thing that is not actually real), seizures, an unbearablecraving for more alcohol, confusion, fever , fast heart rate,',\n  'high blood pressure, and delirium (a fluctuating level of'],\n ['consciousness). Patients at highest risk for the most severesymptoms of withdrawal (referred to as delirium tremens)are those with other medical problems, including malnu-',\n  'trition , liver disease, or Wernicke’s syndrome. Delirium',\n  'GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 97Alcoholism',\n  'Symptoms Of Co-Alcohol Dependence',\n  'Psychological distress manifested in symptoms such as anxiety, aggression, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, depression, insomnia, hyp eractivity, and suicidal tendency',\n  'Psychosomatic illness (ailments that have no biological basis and clear up after the co-alcoholism clears up)Family violence or neglectAlcoholism or other drug abuseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 97 tremens usually begin about three to five days after the',\n  'patient’s last drink, progressing from the more mild symp-toms to the more severe, and may last a number of days.',\n  'Patients going through only mild withdrawal are sim-'],\n ['ply monitored carefully to make sure that more severesymptoms do not develop. No medications are necessary,however. Treatment of a patient suffering the more severeeffects of withdrawal may require the use of sedative med-ications to relieve the discomfort of withdrawal and toavoid the potentially life-threatening complications of highblood pressure, fast heart rate, and seizures. Drugs calledbenzodiazapines are helpful in those patients sufferingfrom hallucinations. Because of the patient’s nausea, fluidsmay need to be given through a vein (intravenously), alongwith some necessary sugars and salts. It is crucial that thi-amine be included in the fluids, because thiamine is usuallyquite low in alcoholic patients, and deficiency of thiamineis responsible for the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.',\n  'After cessation of drinking has been accomplished,',\n  'the next steps involve helping the patient avoid ever tak-ing another drink. This phase of treatment is referred toas rehabilitation . The best programs incorporate the',\n  'family into the therapy, because the family has undoubt-edly been severely affected by the patient’s drinking.Some therapists believe that family members, in an effortto deal with their loved one’s drinking problem, some-times develop patterns of behavior that accidentally sup-port or “enable” the patient’s drinking. This situation isreferred to as “co-dependence,” and must be addressed inorder to successfully treat a person’s alcoholism.',\n  'Sessions led by peers, where recovering alcoholics',\n  'meet regularly and provide support for each other’srecoveries, are considered some of the best methods ofpreventing a return to drinking (relapse). Perhaps themost well-known such group is called AlcoholicsAnonymous, which uses a “12-step” model to help peo-ple avoid drinking. These steps involve recognizing thedestructive power that alcohol has held over the alco-holic’s life, looking to a higher power for help in over-coming the problem, and reflecting on the ways inwhich the use of alcohol has hurt others and, if possi-ble, making amends to those people. According to arecent study reported by the American PsychologicalAssociation (APA), anyone, regardless of his or herreligious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs, can benefitfrom participation in 12-step programs such as Alco-holics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous(NA). The number of visits to 12-step self-help groupsexceeds the number of visits to all mental health profes-sionals combined.',\n  'There are also medications that may help an alco-',\n  'holic avoid returning to drinking. These have been usedwith variable success. Disulfiram (Antabuse) is a drug'],\n ['which, when mixed with alcohol, causes unpleasant reac-tions including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and trembling.Naltrexone, along with a similar compound, Nalmefene,can be helpful in limiting the effects of a relapse. Acam-prosate is helpful in preventing relapse. None of thesemedications would be helpful unless the patient was alsowilling to work very hard to change his or her behavior.',\n  'Alternative treatment',\n  'Alternative treatments can be a helpful adjunct for the',\n  'alcoholic patient, once the medical danger of withdrawalhas passed. Because many alcoholics have very stressfullives (whether because of or leading to the alcoholism issometimes a matter of debate), many of the treatments foralcoholism involve dealing with and relieving stress . These',\n  'include massage, meditation , and hypnotherapy . The',\n  'malnutrition of long-term alcohol use is addressed by nutri-tion-oriented practitioners with careful attention to ahealthy diet and the use of nutritional supplements such asvitamins A, B complex, and C, as well as certain fatty',\n  'acids, amino acids, zinc, magnesium, and selenium. Herbaltreatments include milk thistle( Silybum marianum ), which',\n  'is thought to protect the liver against damage. Other herbsare thought to be helpful for the patient suffering throughwithdrawal. Some of these include lavender ( Lavandula'],\n ['officinalis ), skullcap ( Scutellaria lateriflora ), chamomile',\n  '(Matricaria recutita ), peppermint ( Mentha piperita )',\n  'yarrow ( Achillea millefolium ), and valerian ( Valeriana',\n  'officinalis ). Acupuncture is believed to both decrease',\n  'withdrawal symptoms and to help improve a patient’schances for continued recovery from alcoholism.',\n  'Prognosis',\n  'Recovery from alcoholism is a life-long process. In',\n  'fact, people who have suffered from alcoholism are encour-aged to refer to themselves ever after as “a recovering alco-holic,” never a recovered alcoholic. This is because mostresearchers in the field believe that since the potential foralcoholism is still part of the individual’s biological andpsychological makeup, one can never fully recover fromalcoholism. The potential for relapse (returning to illness)is always there, and must be acknowledged and respected.Statistics suggest that, among middle-class alcoholics instable financial and family situations who have undergonetreatment, 60% or more can be successful at an attempt tostop drinking for at least a year, and many for a lifetime.'],\n ['Prevention',\n  'Prevention must begin at a relatively young age',\n  'since the first instance of intoxication (drunkenness) usu-',\n  'GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 98AlcoholismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 98 ally occurs during the teenage years.

It specifically binds CD52, a protein found onthe surface of essentially all B and T cells of the immunesystem.

Alemtuzumab is a humanized antibody, mean-ing that the regions that bind CD52, located on the tips ofthe Y branches, are derived from rat antibodies, but therest of the antibody is human sequence. The presence ofthe human sequences helps to reduce the immuneresponse by the patient against the antibody itself, aproblem seen when complete mouse antibodies are usedfor cancer therapies.

The goal of the techniqueis to restore freedom and expression to the body andclear thinking to the mind.',\n  'Purpose',\n  'Because the Alexander technique helps students',\n  'improve overall functioning, both mental and physical, itoffers a wide range of benefits. Nikolaas Tinbergen, in his1973 Nobel lecture, hailed the “striking improvements insuch diverse things as high blood pressure, breathing,depth of sleep, overall cheerfulness and mental alertness,resilience against outside pressures, and the refined skillof playing a musical instrument.” He went on to quote alist of other conditions helped by the Alexander tech-nique: “rheumatism, including various forms of arthritis,then respiratory troubles, and even potentially lethal asth-',\n  'ma; following in their wake, circulation defects, which',\n  'may lead to high blood pressure and also to some danger-ous heart conditions; gastrointestinal disorders of manytypes, various gynecological conditions, sexual failures,migraines and depressive states.”'],\n ['Literature in the 1980s and 1990s went on to include',\n  'improvements in back pain , chronic pain, postural prob-',\n  'GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 103Alexander techniqueGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 103 lems, repetitive strain injury, benefits during pregnancy',\n  'and childbirth , help in applying physical therapy and',\n  'rehabilitative exercises, improvements in strain caused bycomputer use, improvements in the posture and perfor-mance of school children, and improvements in vocal anddramatic performance among the benefits offered by thetechnique.',\n  'Description',\n  'Origins',\n  'Frederick Matthias Alexander was born in 1869 in'],\n ['Tasmania, Australia. He became an actor and Shake-spearean reciter, and early in his career he began to sufferfrom strain on his vocal chords. He sought medical atten-tion for chronic hoarseness, but after treatment with arecommended prescription and extensive periods of rest,his problem persisted.',\n  'Alexander realized that his hoarseness began about',\n  'an hour into a dramatic performance and reasoned that itwas something he did in the process of reciting thatcaused him to lose his voice. Returning to his medicaldoctor, Alexander told him of his observation. When thedoctor admitted that he didn’t know what Alexander wasdoing to injure his vocal chords, Alexander decided to tryand find out for himself.',\n  'Thus began a decade of self-observation and discov-',\n  'ery. Using as many as three mirrors to observe himself inthe act of reciting, normal speaking, and later standing,walking, and sitting, Alexander managed to improve hiscoordination and to overcome his vocal problems. One ofhis most startling discoveries was that in order to changethe way he used his body he had to change the way hewas thinking, redirecting his thoughts in such a way thathe did not produce unnecessary tension when he attempt-ed speech or movement. After making this discovery atthe end of the nineteenth century, Alexander became apioneer in body-mind medicine.',\n  'At first, performers and dancers sought guidance',\n  'from Alexander to overcome physical complaints andto improve the expression and spontaneity of theirperformances. Soon a great number of people soughthelp from his teaching for a variety of physical andmental disorders.',\n  'The Alexander technique is primarily taught one-'],\n ['on-one in private lessons. Introductory workshops orworkshops for special applications of the technique(e.g.,workshops for musicians) are also common. Pri-vate lessons range from a half-hour to an hour in length,and are taught in a series. The number of lessons variesaccording to the severity of the student’s difficultieswith coordination or to the extent of the student’s inter-est in pursuing the improvements made possible by con-',\n  'tinued study. The cost of lessons ranges from $40-80 perhour. Insurance coverage is not widely available, butdiscounts are available for participants in some comple-mentary care insurance plans. Pre-tax Flexible SpendingAccounts for health care cover Alexander techniquelessons if they are prescribed by a physician.',\n  'In lessons teachers guide students through simple',\n  'movements (while students are dressed in comfortableclothing) and use their hands to help students identifyand stop destructive patterns of tension. Tensing arisesfrom mental processes as well as physical, so discussionsof personal reactions or behavior are likely to arise in thecourse of a lesson.',\n  'The technique helps students move with ease and',\n  'improved coordination. At the beginning of a move-ment (the lessons are a series of movements), mostpeople pull back their heads, raise their shoulderstoward their ears, over-arch their lower backs, tightentheir legs, and otherwise produce excessive tension intheir bodies. Alexander referred to this as misuse ofthe body.',\n  'At any point in a movement, proper use can be',\n  'established. If the neck muscles are not over-tensed, thehead will carry slightly forward of the spine, simplybecause it is heavier in the front. When the head is out ofbalance in the forward direction, it sets off a series ofstretch reflexes in the extensor muscles of the back. It isskillful use of these reflexes, along with reflex activity inthe feet and legs, the arms and hands, the breathingmechanism, and other parts of the body, that lessons inthe technique aim to develop.'],\n ['Alexander found that optimal functioning of the',\n  'body was very hard to maintain, even for the short periodof time it took to complete a single movement. People,especially adults, have very strong tension habits associ-ated with movement. Chronic misuse of the muscles iscommon. It may be caused by slouching in front of tele-visions or video monitors, too much sitting or drivingand too little walking, or by tension associated with pasttraumas and injuries. Stiffening the neck after awhiplash injury or favoring a broken or sprained leg',\n  'long after it has healed are examples of habitual tensioncaused by injury.',\n  'The first thing a teacher of the Alexander tech-',\n  'nique does is to increase a student’s sensory awarenessof this excessive habitual tension, particularly that inthe neck and spine. Next the student is taught to inhibitthe tension. If the student prepares to sit down, forexample, he will tense his muscles in his habitual way.If he is asked to put aside the intention to sit andinstead to free his neck and allow less constriction in',\n  'GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 104Alexander techniqueGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 104 his muscles, he can begin to change his tense habitual',\n  'response to sitting.',\n  'By leaving the head resting on the spine in its natur-'],\n ['al free balance, by keeping eyes open and focused, notheld in a tense stare, by allowing the shoulders to release,the knees to unlock and the back to lengthen and widen,a student greatly reduces strain. In Alexander lessons stu-dents learn to direct themselves this way in activity andbecome skilled in fluid, coordinated movement.',\n  'Precautions',\n  'Side effects',\n  'The focus of the Alexander technique is educational.',\n  'Teachers use their hands simply to gently guide studentsin movement. Therefore, both contraindications andpotential physiological side effects are kept to a mini-mum. No forceful treatment of soft tissue or bony struc-ture is attempted, so damage to tissues, even in the caseof errors in teaching, is unlikely.',\n  'As students’ sensory awareness develops in the',\n  'course of Alexander lessons, they become more acutelyaware of chronic tension patterns. As students learn torelease excessive tension in their muscles and to sustainthis release in daily activity, they may experience tight-ness or soreness in the connective tissue. This is causedby the connective tissue adapting to the lengthened andreleased muscles and the expanded range of movementin the joints.',\n  'Occasionally students may get light-headed during a'],\n ['lesson as contracted muscles release and effect the circu-latory or respiratory functioning.',\n  'Forceful contraction of muscles and rigid postures',\n  'often indicate suppression of emotion.

When Aspergillus spores reach the bronchi, which',\n  'are the branches of the windpipe that lead into the lungs,the bronchi react by contracting spasmodically.

It affects between 10-20% of all people inthe United States, and is responsible for 2.5% of all doc-tor visits. Antihistamines and other drugs used to treat',\n  'allergic rhinitis make up a significant fraction of bothprescription and over-the-counter drug sales each year.',\n  'There are two types of allergic rhinitis: seasonal and',\n  'perennial. Seasonal AR occurs in the spring, summer,and early fall, when airborne plant pollens are at theirhighest levels. In fact, the term hay fever is really a mis-nomer, since allergy to grass pollen is only one cause ofsymptoms for most people. Perennial AR occurs all yearand is usually caused by home or workplace airbornepollutants. A person can be affected by one or both types.Symptoms of seasonal AR are worst after being out-doors, while symptoms of perennial AR are worst afterspending time indoors.',\n  'Both types of allergies can develop at any age,',\n  'although onset in childhood through early adulthood ismost common. Although allergy to a particular substanceis not inherited, increased allergic sensitivity may “run inthe family.” While allergies can improve on their ownover time, they can also become worse over time.'],\n ['Causes and symptoms',\n  'Causes',\n  'Allergic rhinitis is a type of immune reaction. Nor-',\n  'mally, the immune system responds to foreign microor-ganisms, or particles, like pollen or dust, by producingspecific proteins, called antibodies, that are capable ofbinding to identifying molecules, or antigens, on the for-eign particle. This reaction between antibody and antigensets off a series of reactions designed to protect the bodyfrom infection. Sometimes, this same series of reactionsis triggered by harmless, everyday substances. This is thecondition known as allergy, and the offending substanceis called an allergen.',\n  'Like all allergic reactions, AR involves a special',\n  'set of cells in the immune system known as mast cells.Mast cells, found in the lining of the nasal passagesand eyelids, display a special type of antibody, calledimmunoglobulin type E (IgE), on their surface. Inside,mast cells store reactive chemicals in small packets,called granules. When the antibodies encounter aller-gens, they trigger release of the granules, which spillout their chemicals onto neighboring cells, includingblood vessels and nerve cells. One of these chemicals,histamine, binds to the surfaces of these other cells,through special proteins called histamine receptors.Interaction of histamine with receptors on blood ves-sels causes neighboring cells to become leaky, leadingto the fluid collection, swelling, and increased rednesscharacteristic of a runny nose and red, irritated eyes.Histamine also stimulates pain receptors, causing the',\n  'itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat common in aller-gic rhinitis.',\n  'The number of possible airborne allergens is enor-'],\n ['mous. Seasonal AR is most commonly caused by grassand tree pollens, since their pollen is produced in largeamounts and is dispersed by the wind. Showy flowers,like roses or lilacs, that attract insects produce a stickypollen which is less likely to become airborne. Differentplants release their pollen at different times of the year,so seasonal AR sufferers may be most affected in spring,summer, or fall, depending on which plants provoke aresponse. The amount of pollen in the air is reflected inthe pollen count, often broadcast on the daily news dur-ing allergy season. Pollen counts tend to be lower after agood rain that washes the pollen out of the air and higheron warm, dry, windy days.',\n  'Virtually any type of tree or grass may cause AR.

AR usually alsocauses redness, itching, and watery eyes. Fatigue and',\n  'headache are also common.',\n  'Diagnosis',\n  'Diagnosing seasonal AR is usually easy and can',\n  'often be done without a medical specialist.

This reaction between antibody andantigen sets off a series of reactions designed to protectthe body from infection. Sometimes, this same series ofreactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substances.This is the condition known as allergy, and the offend-ing substance is called an allergen. Common inhaledallergens include pollen, dust, and insect parts from tinyhouse mites. Common food allergens include nuts, fish,and milk.',\n  'Allergic reactions involve a special set of cells in',\n  'the immune system known as mast cells. Mast cellsserve as guards in the tissues where the body meets theoutside world: the skin, the mucous membranes of theeyes and other areas, and the linings of the respiratoryand digestive systems. Mast cells display a special typeof antibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE), ontheir surface. Inside, mast cells store reactive chemicalsin small packets, called granules. When the antibodiesencounter allergens, they trigger the release of granules,which spill out their chemicals onto neighboring cells,including blood vessels and nerve cells. One of thesechemicals, histamine, binds to the surfaces of theseother cells, through special proteins called histaminereceptors. Interaction of histamine with receptors onblood vessels causes neighboring cells to become leaky,leading to the fluid collection, swelling, and increasedredness characteristic of a runny nose and red, irritatedeyes.

Thisscreening test cannot diagnose a specific condition; itonly indicates the increase of risk for several birthdefects. Outside pregnancy, the AFP test is used to detectliver disease, certain cancerous tumors, and to monitorthe progress of cancer treatment.',\n  'Purpose',\n  'Alpha-fetoprotein is a substance produced by the',\n  'liver of a fetus. The exact function of this protein isunknown. After birth, the infant’s liver stops producingAFP, and an adult liver contains only trace amounts.During pregnancy, the fetus excretes AFP in urine andsome of the protein crosses the fetal membranes to enterthe mother’s blood. The level of AFP can then be deter-mined by analyzing a sample of the mother’s blood. Byanalyzing the amount of AFP found in a blood or amni-otic fluid sample, doctors can determine the probabilitythat the fetus is at risk for certain birth defects. It is veryimportant that the doctor know precisely how old thefetus is when the test is performed since the AFP levelchanges over the length of the pregnancy. Alone, AFPscreening cannot diagnose a birth defect. The test isused as an indicator of risk and then an appropriate lineof testing (like amniocentesis or ultrasound) follows,',\n  'based on the results.',\n  'Abnormally high AFP may indicate that the fetus'],\n ['has an increased risk of a neural tube defect, the mostcommon and severe type of disorder associated withincreased AFP. These types of defects include spinalcolumn defects ( spina bifida ) and anencephaly (a',\n  'severe and usually fatal brain abnormality). If the tubethat becomes the brain and spinal cord does not closecorrectly during fetal development, AFP may leakthrough this abnormal opening and enter the amnioticfluid. This leakage creates abnormally high levels ofAFP in amniotic fluid and in maternal blood. If thescreening test indicates abnormally high AFP, ultra-sound is used to diagnosis the problem.',\n  'Other fetal conditions that can raise AFP levels',\n  'above normal include:',\n  '• cysts at the end of the spine• blockage in the esophagus or intestines',\n  '• liver disease causing liver cells to die',\n  '• defects in the abdominal wall• kidney or urinary tract defects or disease',\n  '• brittle bone disease'],\n ['Levels may also be high if there is too little fluid in',\n  'the amniotic sac around the fetus, more than one devel-oping fetus, or a pregnancy that is farther along thanestimated.',\n  'For unknown reasons, abnormally low AFP may',\n  'indicate that the fetus has an increased risk of Down',\n  'syndrome . Down syndrome is a condition that',\n  'includes mental retardation and a distinctive physical',\n  'appearance linked to an abnormality of chromosome21 (called trisomy 21). If the screening test indicatesan abnormally low AFP, amniocentesis is used to diag-nosis the problem. Abnormally low levels of AFP canalso occur when the fetus has died or when the motheris overweight.',\n  'AFP is often part of a “triple check” blood test that'],\n ['analyzes three substances as risk indicators of possiblebirth defects: AFP, estriol, and human chorionicgonadotropin (HCG).

High altitude is defined asheight greater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m); medium altitudeis defined as height between 5,000 and 8,000 feet(1,524–2,438 m); and extreme altitude is defined asheight greater than 19,000 feet (5,791 m). The majorityof healthy individuals suffer from altitude sickness whenthey reach very high altitudes. In addition, about 20% ofpeople ascending above 9,000 (2,743 m) feet in one daywill develop altitude sickness. Children under six yearsand women in the premenstrual part of their cycles maybe more vulnerable. Individuals with preexisting medicalconditions—even a minor respiratory infection—maybecome sick at more moderate altitudes.',\n  'Description',\n  'There are three major clinical syndromes that fall'],\n ['under the heading of altitude sickness: acute mountainsickness (AMS), high-altitude pulmonary edema',\n  '(HAPE), and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE).',\n  'These syndromes are not separate, individual syndromesas much as they are a continuum of severity, all resultingfrom a decrease in oxygen in the air. AMS is the mildest,and the other two represent severe, life-threatening formsof altitude sickness.',\n  'GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 132Altitude sicknessGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 132 Altitude sickness occurs because the partial pressure',\n  'of oxygen decreases with altitude. (Partial pressure is aterm applied to gases that is similar to the way the termconcentration is applied to liquid solutions.) For instance,at 18,000 feet (5,486 m) the partial pressure of oxygendrops to one-half its value at sea level and, therefore, thereis a substantially lower amount of oxygen available for theindividual to inhale. This is known as hypoxia. Further-more, since there is less oxygen to inhale, less oxygenreaches the blood. This is known as hypoxemia. These twoconditions are the major factors that form the basis for allthe medical problems associated with altitude sickness.',\n  'As a person becomes hypoxemic, his natural',\n  'response is to breathe more rapidly (hyperventilate). Thisis the body’s attempt to bring in more oxygen at a rapidrate. This attempt at alleviating the effects of the hypoxiaat higher altitudes is known as acclimatization, and itoccurs during the first few days. Acclimatization is aresponse that occurs in individuals who travel from lowerto higher altitudes. There are groups of people who havelived at high altitudes (for example, in the Himalayanand Andes mountains) for generations, and they are sim-ply accustomed to living at such altitudes, perhapsthrough a genetic ability.',\n  'Causes and symptoms'],\n ['Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a mild form of',\n  'altitude sickness that results from ascent to altitudes highergreater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m)—even 6,500 feet (1,981m) in some susceptible individuals. Although hypoxia isassociated with the development of AMS, the exact mech-anism by which this condition develops has yet to be con-firmed. It is important to realize that some individualsacclimatize to higher altitudes more efficiently than others.As a result, under similar conditions some will suffer fromAMS while others will not. At present, the susceptibilityof otherwise healthy individuals to contracting AMS can-not be accurately predicted. Of those who do suffer fromAMS, the condition tends to be most severe on the secondor third day after reaching the high altitude, and it usuallyabates after three to five days if they remain at the samealtitude. However, it can recur if the individuals travel toan even higher altitude.

Communication ability,',\n  'mood, and personality may also be affected. Most peoplewho have AD die within eight years of their diagnosis,although that interval may be as short as one year or aslong as 20 years. AD is the fourth leading cause of death',\n  'in adults after heart disease, cancer , and stroke .',\n  'Between two and four million Americans have AD;',\n  'that number is expected to grow to as many as 14 million bythe middle of the 21st century as the population as a wholeages. While a small number of people in their 40s and 50sdevelop the disease (called early-onset AD), AD predomi-nantly affects the elderly. AD affects about 3% of all peoplebetween ages 65 and 74, about 19% of those between 75and 84, and about 47% of those over 85. Slightly morewomen than men are affected with AD, but this may bebecause women tend to live longer, and so there is a higherproportion of women in the most affected age groups.',\n  'The costs for caring for a person with AD is consid-'],\n ['erable. The annual cost of caring for one AD patient in1998 was estimated as about $18,400 for a patient withmild AD, $30,100 for a patient with moderate AD, and$36,100 for a patient with severe AD. The annual directand indirect costs of caring for AD patients in the UnitedStates was estimated to be as much as $100 billion.Slightly more than half of AD patients are cared for athome, while the remainder are cared for in a variety ofhealth care institutions.',\n  'Causes and symptoms',\n  'Causes',\n  'The cause or causes of Alzheimer’s disease are',\n  'unknown. Some strong leads have been found throughrecent research, however, and these have also given sometheoretical support to several new experimental treatments.',\n  'GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 134Alzheimer’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 134 At first AD destroys neurons (nerve cells) in parts of',\n  'the brain that control memory, including the hippocam-pus, which is a structure deep in the deep that controlsshort-term memory. As these neurons in the hippocampusstop functioning, the short-term memory of the personfails, and the ability to perform familiar tasks decreases.Later AD affects the cerebral cortex, particularly the areasresponsible for language and reasoning; this languageskills are lost and the ability to make judgments ischanged. Personality changes occur, which may includeemotional outbursts, wandering, and agitation. The sever-ity of these changes increases with the progression of thedisease. Eventually many other areas of the brain becomeinvolved, the brain regions affected atrophy (shrink andlose function), and the person with AD becomes bedrid-den, incontinent, helpless, and non-responsive.',\n  'Autopsy of a person with AD shows that the regions'],\n ['of the brain affected by the disease become clogged withtwo abnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tanglesand amyloid plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twistedmasses of protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons. InAD, tau proteins, which normally help bind and stabilizeparts of neurons, is changed chemically, become twistedand tangled, and no longer can stabilize the neurons.Amyloid plaques consist of insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid (a protein fragment from a larger protein calledamyloid precursor protein (APP) mixed with parts of neu-rons and non-nerve cells. Plaques are found in the spacesbetween the nerve cells of the brain. While it is not clearexactly how these structures cause problems, manyresearchers believe that their formation is responsible forthe mental changes of AD, presumably by interferingwith the normal communication between neurons in thebrain and later leading to the death of neurons. As of2000, three drugs for the treatment of AD symptoms havebeen approved by the United States Food and DrugAdministration (FDA). They act by increasing the level ofchemical signaling molecules in the brain, known as neu-rotransmitters, to make up for this decreased communica-tion ability. All act by inhibiting the activity of acetyl-cholinesterase, which is an enzyme that breaks downacetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter released byneurons that is necessary for cognitive function. Thesedrugs modestly increase cognition and improve one’sability to perform normal activities of daily living.',\n  'What triggers the formation of plaques and tangles',\n  'and the development of AD are unknown. AD likelyresults from many interrelated factors, including genetic,environmental, and others not yet identified. Two typesof AD exist: familial AD (FAD), which is a rare autoso-mal dominant inherited disease, and sporadic AD, withno obvious inheritance pattern. AD is also described interms of age at onset, with early on-set AD occurring inpeople younger than 65, and late-onset occurring in those',\n  '65 and older. Early on-set AD comprises about 5-10 ofAD cases and affects people aged 30 to 60. Some casesof early on-set AD are inherited and are common in somefamilies. Early-onset AD often progresses faster than themore common late-on-set type.',\n  'All FAD, which are relatively uncommon, that have',\n  'been identified so far are the early on-set type. As manyas 50% of the FAD cases are known to be caused by threegenes located on three different chromosomes. Somefamilies have mutations in the APP gene located on chro-mosome 21, which causes the production of abnormalAPP protein. Others have mutations in a gene called pre-senilin 1 located on chromosome 14, which causes theproduction of abnormal presenilin 1 protein, and othershave mutations in a similar gene called presenilin 2 locat-ed on chromosome 1, which causes production of abnor-mal presenilin 2. Presenilin 1 may be one of the enzymesthat clips APP into beta-amyloid; it may also be importantin the synaptic connections between brain cells.',\n  'There is no evidence that the mutated genes that',\n  'cause early on-set FAD also cause late on-set AD, butgenetics does appear to play a role in this more commonform of AD. Discovered by researchers at Duke Univer-sity in the early 1990s, potentially the most importantgenetic link to AD was on chromosome 19. A gene onthis chromosome, called APOE (apolipoprotein E), codesfor a protein involved in transporting lipids into neurons.APOE occurs in at least three forms (alleles), calledAPOE e2, APOE e3, and APOE e4. Each person inheritsone APOE from each parent, and therefore can eitherhave one copy of two different forms, or two copies ofone. The relatively rare APOE e2 appears to protect somepeople from AD, as it seems to be associated with alower risk of AD and a later age of onset if AD doesdevelop. APOE e3 is the most common version found inthe general population, and only appears to have a neu-tral role in AD. However, APOE e4 appears to increasethe risk of developing late onset AD with the inheritanceof one or two copies of APOE e4. Compared to thosewithout APOE e4, people with one copy are about threetimes as likely to develop late-onset AD, and those withtwo copies are almost four times as likely to do so. Hav-ing APOE e4 can also lower the age of onset by as muchas 17 years. However, APOE e4 only increases the risk ofdeveloping AD and does not cause it, as not everyonewith APOE e4 develops AD, and people without it canstill have the disease. Why APOE e4 increases thechances of developing AD is not known with certainty.However, one theory is that APOE e4 facilitates beta-amyloid buildup in plaques, thus contributing to the low-ering of the age of onset of AD; other theories involveinteractions with cholesterol levels and effects on nerve'],\n ['GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 135Alzheimer’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 135 cell death independent of its effects on plaque buildup. In',\n  '2000, four new AD-related regions in the human genomewere identified, where one out of several hundred genesin each of these regions may be a risk factor gene for AD.These genes, which are not yet identified, appear to makea contribution to the risk of developing late-onset ADthat is at least as important as APOE e4.',\n  'Other non-genetic factors have also been studied in',\n  'relation to the causes of AD. Inflammation of the brainmay play a role in development of AD, and use of nons-',\n  'teroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seems to',\n  'reduce the risk of developing AD. Restriction of bloodflow may be part of the problem, perhaps accounting forthe beneficial effects of estrogen, which increases bloodflow in the brain, among its other effects. Highly reactivemolecular fragments called free radicals damage cells ofall kinds, especially brain cells, which have smaller sup-plies of protective antioxidants thought to protect againstfree radical damage. Vitamin E is one such antioxidant,and its use in AD may be of possible theoretical benefit.',\n  'While the ultimate cause or causes of Alzheimer’s',\n  'disease are still unknown, there are several risk factorsthat increase a person’s likelihood of developing the dis-ease. The most significant one is, of course, age; olderpeople develop AD at much higher rates than youngerones. There is some evidence that strokes and AD may belinked, with small strokes that go undetected clinicallycontributing to the injury of neurons. Blood cholesterollevels may also be important. Scientists have shown thathigh blood cholesterol levels in special breeds of geneti-cally engineered (transgenic) mice may increase the rateof plaque deposition. There are also parallels betweenAD and other progressive neurodegenerative disordersthat cause dementia, including prion diseases, Parkin-son’s disease, and Huntington’s disease.'],\n ['Numerous epidemiological studies of populations are',\n  'also being conducted to learn more about whether and towhat extent early life events, socioeconomic factors, andethnicity have an impact on the development of AD. Forexample, results from one study indicated that rural resi-dence in childhood, along with fewer than six years ofschooling, was associated with increased AD risk. How-ever, the low educational attainment that was identified asa risk factor might be a marker or surrogate for other dele-terious socioeconomic or environmental influences inchildhood, thus illustrating the difficulties in interpretingepidemiological findings, due to the complexity of theissues and the large number of variables involved.',\n  'Many environmental factors have been suspected of',\n  'contributing to AD, but epidemiological population stud-ies have not borne out these links. Among these havebeen pollutants in drinking water, aluminum from com-mercial products, and metal dental fillings. To date, none',\n  'of these factors has been shown to cause AD or increaseits likelihood. Further research may yet turn up links toother environmental factors.',\n  'Symptoms',\n  'The symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease begin gradu-',\n  'ally, usually with memory lapses.

Theperson with AD may begin with only the routine sort ofmemory lapse—forgetting where the car keys are—butprogress to more profound or disturbing losses, such asforgetting that he or she can even drive a car. Becominglost or disoriented on a walk around the neighborhoodbecomes more likely as the disease progresses.

Some patients havetrouble sleeping and may suffer from confusion or agita-tion in the evening (“sunsetting” or Sundowner’s Syn-drome).

Its beneficial effects are usually mild and temporary, butit may delay the need for nursing home admission.

It is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaningthat when a decrease in vision is detected, other causesmust be ruled out. Once no other cause is found, ambly-opia is the diagnosis. Generally, a difference of two linesor more (on an eye-chart test of visual acuity) betweenthe two eyes or a best corrected vision of 20/30 or worsewould be defined as amblyopia. For example, if someonehas 20/20 vision with the right eye and only 20/40 withthe left, and the left eye cannot achieve better vision withcorrective lenses, the left eye is said to be amblyopic.',\n  'Description',\n  'Lazy eye is a common non-medical term used to',\n  'describe amblyopia because the eye with poorer visiondoesn’t seem to be doing its job of seeing. Amblyopia isthe most common cause of impaired vision in children,affecting nearly three out of every 100 people or 2-4%of the population. Vision is a combination of the clarityof the images of the eyes (visual acuity) and the process-ing of those images by the brain. If the images producedby the two eyes are substantially different, the brain maynot be able to fuse the images. Instead of seeing two dif-ferent images or double vision (diplopia), the brain sup-presses the blurrier image. This suppression can lead toamblyopia. During the first few years of life, preferringone eye over the other may lead to poor visual develop-ment in the blurrier eye.',\n  'Causes and symptoms',\n  'Some of the major causes of amblyopia are as follows:•Strabismus . A misalignment of the eyes (strabismus) is',\n  'the most common cause of functional amblyopia. Thetwo eyes are looking in two different directions at thesame time. The brain is sent two different images andthis causes confusion. Images from the misaligned or“crossed” eye are turned off to avoid double vision.'],\n ['• Anisometropia. This is another type of functional',\n  'amblyopia. In this case, there is a difference of refrac-tive states between the two eyes (in other words, a dif-ference of prescriptions between the two eyes). Forexample, one eye may be more nearsighted than theother eye, or one eye may be farsighted and the othereye nearsighted. Because the brain cannot fuse the twodissimilar images, the brain will suppress the blurrierimage, causing the eye to become amblyopic.',\n  '• Cataract. Clouding of the lens of the eye will cause the',\n  'image to be blurrier than the other eye. The brain“prefers” the clearer image. The eye with the cataractmay become amblyopic.',\n  '•Ptosis . This is the drooping of the upper eyelid. If light',\n  'cannot enter the eye because of the drooping lid, theeye is essentially not being used. This can lead toamblyopia.',\n  '•Nutrition .

There may be a “critical period” in the develop-ment of vision, and amblyopia may not be treatable afterage eight or nine. The earlier amblyopia is found, the betterthe possible outcome. Most physicians test vision as part ofa child’s medical examination. If there is any sign of an eyeproblem, they may refer a child to an eye specialist.',\n  'There are objective methods, such as retinoscopy, to',\n  'measure the refractive status of the eyes.

An exami-nation of the eyes and visual system is very importantwhen there is an unexplained decrease in vision.'],\n ['Treatment',\n  'The primary treatment for amblyopia is occlusion',\n  'therapy. It is important to alternate patching the good eye(forcing the amblyopic eye to work) and the amblyopiceye. If the good eye is constantly patched, it too maybecome amblyopic because of disuse. The treatment planshould be discussed with the doctor to fully understandhow long the patch will be on. When patched, eye exercis-es may be prescribed to force the amblyopic eye to focusand work. This is called vision therapy or vision training',\n  '(eye exercises). Even after vision has been restored in theweak eye, part-time patching may be required over a peri-od of years to maintain the improvement.',\n  'While patching is necessary to get the amblyopic',\n  'eye to work, it is just as important to correct the reasonfor the amblyopia.

(A transient ischemic attack ,',\n  'sometimes called “a small stroke,” occurs when ablockage in an artery temporarily blocks off blood sup-ply to part of the brain.) A victim experiences suddenconfusion and forgetfulness. Attacks can be as brief as30-60 minutes or can last up to 24 hours.

By 1997, approximately800 different diagnostic tests were available, most ofthem for hereditary genetic disorders such as Tay-Sachs',\n  'disease , sickle cell anemia, hemophilia ,muscular dys-',\n  'trophy and cystic fibrosis .',\n  'Amniocentesis, often called amnio, is recommended'],\n ['for women who will be older than 35 on their due-date. Itis also recommended for women who have already bornechildren with birth defects , or when either of the parents',\n  'has a family history of a birth defect for which a diagnos-tic test is available. Another reason for the procedure is toconfirm indications of Down syndrome and certain otherdefects which may have shown up previously during rou-tine maternal blood screening.',\n  'The risk of bearing a child with a nonhereditary',\n  'genetic defect such as Down syndrome is directly relat-ed to a woman’s age—the older the woman, the greaterthe risk. Thirty-five is the recommended age to beginamnio testing because that is the age at which the risk ofcarrying a fetus with such a defect roughly equals therisk of miscarriage caused by the procedure—about',\n  'one in 200. At age 25, the risk of giving birth to a childwith this type of defect is about one in 1,400; by age 45it increases to about one in 20. Nearly half of all preg-nant women over 35 in the United States undergoamniocentesis and many younger women also decide tohave the procedure. Notably, some 75% of all Downsyndrome infants born in the United States each year areto women younger than 35.',\n  'One of the most common reasons for performing',\n  'amniocentesis is an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)test. Alpha-fetoprotein is a protein produced by the fetusand present in the mother’s blood. A simple bloodscreening, usually conducted around the 15th week ofpregnancy, can determine the AFP levels in the mother’sblood. Levels that are too high or too low may signalpossible fetal defects. Because this test has a high false-positive rate, another test such as amnio is recommendedwhenever the AFP levels fall outside the normal range.',\n  'Amniocentesis is generally performed during the'],\n ['16th week of pregnancy, with results usually availablewithin three weeks. It is possible to perform an amnio asearly as the 11th week but this is not usually recommend-ed because there appears to be an increased risk of mis-carriage when done at this time. The advantage of earlyamnio and speedy results lies in the extra time for deci-sion making if a problem is detected. Potential treatmentof the fetus can begin earlier. Important, also, is the factthat elective abortions are safer and less controversial the',\n  'earlier they are performed.',\n  'Precautions',\n  'As an invasive surgical procedure, amnio poses a real,',\n  'although small, risk to the health of a fetus. Parents mustweigh the potential value of the knowledge gained, orindeed the reassurance that all is well, against the small riskof damaging what is in all probability a normal fetus. Theserious emotional and ethical dilemmas that adverse testresults can bring must also be considered. The decision toundergo amnio is always a matter of personal choice.',\n  'Description',\n  'The word amniocentesis literally means “puncture',\n  'of the amnion,” the thin-walled sac of fluid in which adeveloping fetus is suspended during pregnancy. Duringthe sampling procedure, the obstetrician inserts a veryfine needle through the woman’s abdomen into the uterusand amniotic sac and withdraws approximately oneounce of amniotic fluid for testing. The relatively pain-less procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, some-times using local anesthesia.'],\n ['The physician uses ultrasound images to guide nee-',\n  'dle placement and collect the sample, thereby minimiz-ing the risk of fetal injury and the need for repeated nee-dle insertions. Once the sample is collected, the womancan return home after a brief observation period. Shemay be instructed to rest for the first 24 hours and toavoid heavy lifting for two days.',\n  'The sample of amniotic fluid is sent to a laboratory',\n  'where fetal cells contained in the fluid are isolated andgrown in order to provide enough genetic material fortesting. This takes about seven to 14 days. The material isthen extracted and treated so that visual examination fordefects can be made. For some disorders, like Tay-Sachs,the simple presence of a telltale chemical compound inthe amniotic fluid is enough to confirm a diagnosis.Depending on the specific tests ordered, and the skill ofthe lab conducting them, all the results are availablebetween one and four weeks after the sample is taken.',\n  'Cost of the procedure depends on the doctor, the lab,',\n  'and the tests ordered. Most insurers provide coverage forwomen over 35, as a follow-up to positive maternalblood screening results, and when genetic disorders runin the family.',\n  'An alternative to amnio, now in general use, is chori-',\n  'onic villus sampling , or CVS, which can be performed as'],\n ['early as the eighth week of pregnancy.

ALS affects “volun-tary” muscles, those controlled by conscious thought,such as the arm, leg, and trunk muscles. ALS, in and ofitself, does not affect sensation, thought processes, theheart muscle, or the “smooth” muscle of the digestive sys-tem, bladder, and other internal organs.

Anemia develops whenheavy bleeding causes significant iron loss or when some-thing happens to slow down the production of red bloodcells or to increase the rate at which they are destroyed.',\n  'Types of anemia',\n  'Anemia can be mild, moderate, or severe enough to',\n  'lead to life-threatening complications. More than 400different types of anemia have been identified. Many ofthem are rare.',\n  'IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Iron deficiency ane-',\n  'miais the most common form of anemia in the world. In',\n  'the United States, iron deficiency anemia affects about240,000 toddlers between one and two years of age and3.3 million women of childbearing age. This condition isless common in older children and in adults over 50 andrarely occurs in teenage boys and young men.',\n  'The onset of iron deficiency anemia is gradual and,'],\n ['at first, there may not be any symptoms. The deficiencybegins when the body loses more iron than it derivesfrom food and other sources. Because depleted ironstores cannot meet the red blood cell’s needs, fewer redblood cells develop. In this early stage of anemia, the redblood cells look normal, but they are reduced in number.Then the body tries to compensate for the iron deficiencyby producing more red blood cells, which are character-istically small in size. Symptoms develop at this stage.',\n  'FOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY ANEMIA.

A combi-nation of inhaled anesthetic gases and intravenous drugsare usually delivered during general anesthesia; thispractice is called balanced anesthesia and is used becauseit takes advantage of the beneficial effects of each anes-thetic agent to reach surgical anesthesia. If necessary, theextent of the anesthesia produced by inhaling a generalanesthetic can be rapidly modified by adjusting the con-centration of the anesthetic in the oxygen that is breathedby the patient. The degree of anesthesia produced by anintravenously injected anesthesic is fixed and cannot bechanged as rapidly. Most commonly, intravenous anes-thetic agents are used for induction of anesthesia andthen followed by inhaled anesthetic agents.',\n  'General anesthesia works by altering the flow of',\n  'sodium molecules into nerve cells (neurons) through thecell membrane. Exactly how the anesthetic does this isnot understood since the drug apparently does not bind toany receptor on the cell surface and does not seem toaffect the release of chemicals that transmit nerveimpulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells. It isknown, however, that when the sodium molecules do notget into the neurons, nerve impulses are not generatedand the brain becomes unconscious, does not store mem-ories, does not register pain impulses from other areas ofthe body, and does not control involuntary reflexes.Although anesthesia may feel like deep sleep, it is not thesame. In sleep, some parts of the brain speed up whileothers slow down. Under anesthesia, the loss of con-sciousness is more widespread.When general anesthesia was first introduced in',\n  'medical practice, ether and chloroform were inhaled withthe physician manually covering the patient’s mouth.Since then, general anesthesia has become much moresophisticated. During most surgical procedures, anesthet-ic agents are now delivered and controlled by computer-ized equipment that includes anesthetic gas monitoringas well as patient monitoring equipment. Anesthesiolo-gists are the physicians that specialize in the delivery ofanesthetic agents. Currently used inhaled general anes-thetics include halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desfluo-rane, sevofluorane, and nitrous oxide.'],\n ['• Halothane (Fluothane) is a powerful anesthetic and can',\n  'easily be overadministered. This drug causes uncon-sciousness but little pain relief so it is often used withother agents to control pain. Very rarely, it can be toxicto the liver in adults, causing death. It also has thepotential for causing serious cardiac dysrhythmias.Halothane has a pleasant odor, and was frequently theanesthetic of choice for use with children, but since theintroduction of sevofluorane in the 1990s, halothaneuse has declined.',\n  '• Enflurane (Ethrane) is less potent and results in a',\n  'more rapid onset of anesthesia and faster awakeningthan halothane. In addition, it acts as an enhancer ofparalyzing agents. Enflurane has been found toincrease intracranial pressure and the risk of seizures;therefore, its use is contraindicated in patients withseizure disorders.',\n  '• Isoflurane (Forane) is not toxic to the liver but can',\n  'cause some cardiac irregularities. Isofluorane is oftenused in combination with intravenous anesthetics foranesthesia induction. Awakening from anesthesia isfaster than it is with halothane and enfluorane.',\n  '• Desfluorane (Suprane) may increase the heart rate and',\n  'should not be used in patients with aortic valve steno-'],\n ['sis; however, it does not usually cause heart arrhyth-',\n  'mias . Desflurane may cause coughing and excitation',\n  'during induction and is therefore used with intravenousanesthetics for induction. Desflurane is rapidly elimi-nated and awakening is therefore faster than with otherinhaled agents.',\n  '• Sevofluorane (Ultane) may also cause increased heart',\n  'rate and should not be used in patients with narrowedaortic valve (stenosis); however, it does not usuallycause heart arrhythmias. Unlike desfluorane, sevofluo-rane does not cause any coughing or other related sideeffects, and can therefore be used without intravenousagents for rapid induction.

Also, propo-fol is rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted inthe urine, so it can be used for long durations of anes-thesia, unlike thiopental.

Unpleasant side effects are also less common.',\n  'Recommended dosage',\n  'The dosage depends on the type of anesthetic, the',\n  'patient’s age and physical condition, the type of surgeryor medical procedure being done, and other medicationthe patient takes before, during, or after surgery.',\n  'Precautions'],\n ['Although the risks of serious complications from',\n  'general anesthesia are very low, they can include heart',\n  'attack ,stroke , brain damage, and death. Anyone sched-',\n  'uled to undergo general anesthesia should thoroughlydiscuss the benefits and risks with a physician. The risksof complications depend, in part, on a patient’s age, sex,weight, allergies, general health, and history of smoking ,',\n  'drinking alcohol, or drug use. Some of these risks can beminimized by ensuring that the physician and anesthesi-ologist are fully informed of the detailed health conditionof the patient, including any drugs that he or she may beusing. Older people are especially sensitive to the effectsof certain anesthetics and may be more likely to experi-ence side effects from these drugs.',\n  'Patients who have had general anesthesia should not',\n  'drink alcoholic beverages or take medication that slowdown the central nervous system (such as antihista-',\n  'mines , sedatives, tranquilizers, sleep aids, certain pain'],\n ['relievers, muscle relaxants , and anti-seizure medication)',\n  'for at least 24 hours, except under a doctor’s care.',\n  'Special conditions',\n  'People with certain medical conditions are at greater',\n  'risk of developing problems with anesthetics.

Signs of malignant',\n  'hyperthermia include rapid, irregular heartbeat, breath-ing problems, very high fever , and muscle tightness or',\n  'spasms. These symptoms can occur following the admin-istration of general anesthesia using inhaled agents, espe-cially halothane. In addition, the doctor should also betold about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, orother substances.',\n  'PREGNANCY. The effects of anesthetics on pregnant',\n  'women and fetuses vary, depending on the type of drug. Ingeneral, giving large amounts of general anesthetics to themother during labor and delivery may make the baby slug-gish after delivery. Pregnant women should discuss the useof anesthetics during labor and delivery with their doctors.Pregnant women who may be given general anesthesia forother medical procedures should ensure that the treatingphysician is informed about the pregnancy .',\n  'BREASTFEEDING.
